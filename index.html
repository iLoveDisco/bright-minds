                    Does your young pre-reader have trouble learning his/her letter names and sounds? 
                    Does he/she guess at words instead of sounding them out?

                    Learning to Read means breaking the alphabetic code. 
                    Our word builder booklets provide a step-by-step program with ample practice that allows the student to combine phonetic sounds to decode words. 
                    Research concludes that students who are skilled decoders are shown to have increased fluency and improved comprehension. 
                    The Dolch sight words are also included in the program. Since these words are studied in first and second grades, children who master them have a good base for beginning reading.
